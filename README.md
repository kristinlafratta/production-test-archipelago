# Production GitHub Test

Hello! My name is Kristin LaFratta. I am excited for the opportunity to work at **O'Reilly Media** and learn the ins and outs of markdown language and Chicago Manual Style. I look forward to speaking with Dan Fauxsmith and Melanie Yarbrough on August 25, 2016 to learn more about the **Production Editor** position.
